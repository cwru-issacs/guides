## Board Pinouts & Schematics

### Arduino UNO

:warning: **WARNING**: This board has 5V I/O Pins.  Connecting 3.3V-only sensors will result in damaging the sensor.  Use a voltage translator to step the I/O voltage down to 3.3V.  Refer to the sensor's datasheet for the safe I/O voltage range.

The [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) is a good inexpensive beginners board for simple projects.  The hardware is open source so there are many clones available or you can even build your own Uno from components on a breadboard [[link](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-an-Arduino-Uno-on-a-BreadBoard/)].

[**think\[box\]**]() has Arduino Uno boards available for purchase. See a staff member at the 3rd floor front desk.

### Arduino MEGA

:warning: **WARNING**: This board has 5V I/O Pins.  Connecting 3.3V-only sensors will result in damaging the sensor.  Use a voltage translator to step the I/O voltage down to 3.3V.  Refer to the sensor's datasheet for the safe I/O voltage range.

The [Arduino Mega 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3) is similar to the Arduino Uno but has many more I/O pins and an upgraded processor.
